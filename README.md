# üèüÔ∏è Sports Data Analysis ‚Äì Player Evaluation & Recommendation Tool

This project analyzes and models football player data to help clubs make data-driven decisions in player selection and squad building based on performance metrics and budget constraints.

##  Objectives
- Clean and preprocess player data from a football dataset
- Visualize trends and correlations between attributes (e.g., age, potential, wage)
- Predict player position using a Random Forest classifier
- Estimate player value using linear regression
- Build a recommendation tool for coaches to select top players by budget and position

## Key Features
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, converting units (height, weight, salary)
- Exploratory data analysis: heatmaps, bar plots, geographical visualizations
- Predictive models:
  - **Classification**: Predict player position from stats using Random Forest
  - **Regression**: Estimate player market value based on performance and contract details
- **Player Recommendation System**: Select top 20 players by budget and desired position
- Tools: R, ggplot2, dplyr, caret, readr, tidyverse

## Output
A lightweight analytics pipeline and recommendation tool that supports coaches and club managers in building optimized teams under budget constraints.
